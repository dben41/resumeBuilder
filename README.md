resumeBuilder
=============

A project done at for CS4540 at the University of Utah to create a Resume building website. It was written in PHP, and it uses MYSQL to store all the users and their associated Resumes. It uses authentication, various levels of permissions and views, and sessions to make a robust and dynamic application. The whole project isn't included in this preview. Please contact me if you wish to view all the code.
